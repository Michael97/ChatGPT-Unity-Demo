# ChatGPT-Unity-Demo: A hands-on exploration of OpenAI's ChatGPT model inside Unity as an AI Agent.

## :star2: Project Overview

This project, currently under active development, represents a hands-on exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the gaming industry. By integrating the OpenAI API wrapper into a rudimentary 2D game, I've equipped an agent with the ability to understand, interact with, and navigate the gaming environment based on predefined actions. This approach underscores the potential of LLMs to augment gameplay and bolster player immersion.

While this project demonstrates the initial promise of LLMs in gaming, including enhancing game experiences, facilitating complex in-game situations, and potentially sparking innovation in game design, it's important to note that it is an ongoing work in progress. As a solo developer working on this project in my spare time, updates may be sporadic. Nonetheless, this project aims to serve as a practical example for other developers interested in harnessing the power of LLMs within their gaming projects, specifically within the Unity game engine.




## :rocket: Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to get the project onto your local machine.

2. **Install Unity**: Make sure you have the correct version of Unity, as specified in `ProjectVersion.txt`.

3. **Open the Project**: Add the project to the Unity Hub and open it.

4. **Install Dependencies**: The OpenAI API wrapper is fetched automatically from `https://github.com/hexthedev/OpenAi-Api-Unity.git`.

5. **API Key**: Head over to the OpenAI API wrapper repo and follow the steps there.

6. **Run the Project**: Open the "SingleAgent" scene and press the `Play` button. You can add more agents, but costs will increase and functionality around this is still WiP.






## :computer: How to Use the Project

This section provides an overview of how to use the project, including instructions on adding new tiles, agents, and other customizations. Follow the sub-sections below to get started:

### Adding New Tiles

To add new tiles to the game, follow these steps:

1. Go to Assets/Prefabs/Tiles/Data
2. Right click -> Create -> TileData -> CustomTileDataSO
3. Implement the necessary functionality and behaviors for your custom tile.
4. Drag the BaseTile from Assets/Prefabs/Tiles/Default into the scene and unpack completely. 
5. Add your new data to the tile, and/or update the tile script to what you want your tile to be Assets/Scripts/Tiles.
6. Rename tile to your liking and make it a prefab to save it
7. Add this new prefab to the tile palette Assets/Palettes/WorldPalette.prefab
8. Test the new tile in the game to ensure it functions as expected.

### Adding New Agents

To introduce new agents or AI characters to the game, follow these steps:

1. Go to Assets/ScriptableObjects/Agents
2. Right click -> Create -> ChatGpt -> ChatGptAgentData
3. Update name and personailty (Possibly extended in the future).
4. Find GPTInitializer in the scene to add it to the scene.

### Logs
The project incorporates logging functionality through the GameLogger. Logging information is displayed in the console section of Unity, and a log file named "game_logs.txt" is saved for reference.

The logs capture various types of information related to the project's execution, including:

1. Messages to and from the ChatGPT agent: 
This includes the input messages from the game and the corresponding responses generated by the ChatGPT model.
2. Function calls: 
The logs track the execution of functions triggered by the AI agent, providing visibility into the actions performed within the game environment.
3. Function status: 
The logs indicate whether functions executed successfully or encountered any errors, allowing for easy debugging and troubleshooting.

## :gear: How the AI Agent Works
The AI agent in this project operates based on a structured message exchange system between Unity and the ChatGPT model. Here's an overview of how it functions:

### Prompt Design: 
The AI agent's behavior is shaped by a carefully designed prompt that includes a task, agent identity, personality traits, and information about the game environment. The prompt provides context for the agent's decision-making process and helps simulate human-like behavior. Numeric values, such as vector positions, are presented in natural language explanations for better understanding.

### Message Response: 
The ChatGPT model generates responses to messages received from the player. These responses are structured in JSON format and contain instructions, suggestions, or insights relevant to the game scenario. While the model strives to provide meaningful responses, there can be occasional issues such as excessive newlines or instances where the response format deviates from the expected JSON structure. These issues are more common with the ChatGPT 3.5-turbo model, while the upcoming GPT-4 model shows improvements in response quality. However, it's important to consider the increased cost associated with using GPT-4.

### Parsing and Function Execution: 
The AI agent parses the response from the ChatGPT model to extract the relevant information. The response is in JSON format, enabling easy retrieval of the data needed for further processing. The extracted information is then used to trigger specific functions through the action factory. These functions directly control the character in the game, allowing the AI agent to perform actions such as movement, object interaction, and decision-making within the Unity environment.

By utilizing this message-based communication approach, along with JSON parsing and function execution, the AI agent effectively interacts with the ChatGPT model, responds to player input, and controls the character in the game world. While occasional issues may arise with the response quality of the ChatGPT model, ongoing updates to the project aim to address these issues. Additionally, the upcoming GPT-4 model shows promise in providing more reliable and structured responses, although at a higher cost.

## :bulb: Project Insights

This project began its journey at a time when the potential of large language models (LLMs) in gaming was just being realized. Since then, remarkable advancements in the field, such as Voyager, have greatly influenced our understanding of AI agents in game environments.

Voyager, an LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft, introduced a groundbreaking approach to AI agent implementation. Unlike my version, Voyager adopts a self-generated plan by leveraging its own capabilities. It autonomously creates plans and writes code based on those plans. In contrast, my current implementation lacks a specific plan and relies on a generic "survive" objective. As a result, the chat-based LLM can sometimes generate hallucinatory responses and fail to perform adequately.

Drawing inspiration from Voyager's findings, it is evident that improving the prompt and providing clearer world data can significantly enhance the LLM's performance. By incorporating Voyager's approach of enabling the LLM to develop its own plans, we can expect to witness substantial improvements in generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

While my implementation was on the right track, these insights from Voyager's research provide a clear direction for enhancing the prompt and refining the interactions between the AI agent and the game environment. By allowing the LLM to generate its own plans based on its knowledge and understanding of the game world, we can unlock the full potential of LLMs in this project. As time permits, I plan to incorporate these improvements to further showcase the capabilities of LLMs in gaming and demonstrate the significant enhancements they can bring to AI agent performance.
